               <p>A 5XX Error is an error generated by the server, not the website. They are visible in any operating system so you may see this type of error message when using a desktop computer, tablet or smartphone. Server errors are often displayed inside the internet browser window just as web pages appear.</p> 
                <ul class="error-list">
                    <li class="list-title">500 HTTP Error</li>
                    <p>It simply means that there is a problem on the server relating to the website, but is not definite about it. In other words, itâ€™s a programming error.I have faced this majorly when using IRCTC webiste, I dont know how many know it but it is usee for railway tickets booking.</p>
                    <li class="list-title">502 HTTP Error</li>
                    <p>The 502 error also incorporates a lot of circumstances and notifies you that a server demanded to make the action requested has returned a response that was not correct to the operation. This in simple terams means that an invalid response has been given by the server for your request.</p>
                    <li class="list-title">503 HTTP Error</li>
                    <p>This error occurs very frequently and we have encountered in somepoint of our online journey it simply means something broke and the server is not able to return the requested information by us. The server for the website you are trying to obtain is not available at that moment. It may be due to heavy traffic or maintenance.This error in simple terms means service is unavailable please check back later. This is due to server problems and not our side.</p>
