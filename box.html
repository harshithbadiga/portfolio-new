            <p>The CSS Box Model is used to create a definition for the way the HTML elements are organized on the screen. This approach accounts for options such as margins, padding, borders, and all the properties that manipulate them. </p> 
             <ul class="error-list">
                 <li class="list-title">The Margin</li>
                 <p>On the CSS Box Model, the margin is the section in the exterior. This edge extends around the box model taking the empty space between the margin and border properties. You can consider this a buffer area that separates the interior of the CSS box model from other HTML elements on a page. </p>
                 <li class="list-title">The Border</li>
                 <p>The border area exists as a boundary between the margin and padding properties of the box. We use it majorly to make cards and buttons. They are most easily visible and we have been used border since childhood in art too. We use border-radius to round the border and give a circle-like effect</p>
                 <li class="list-title">The Padding</li>
                 <p>The padding section of the CSS Box Model sits in the space between the HTML content and the border. It is used to generate space around an e;ements content inside well defined borders. Padding is one property that is majorly used in CSS. It is most well known to be used in buttons.</p>
                 <li class="list-title">
                    The Content</li>
                 <p> This is the main HTML content you are working to display on the site. This can range from an image, a paragraph, or even a web button.The content is they key to any element based on the content the rest of the properties are decided.Just like anywhere based on the content everything else is decided.</p>
                 <li class="list-title">
                    The Height and Width</li>
                 <p>The properties for height and width on the box model are set through the calculations of the applied contents. However, these can also be specified directly as needed to fit the page design.We use various units to define the height and width. We majorly use veiwport-height and viewport-width and pixels. We use pixels majorly to hardcode values. </p>
